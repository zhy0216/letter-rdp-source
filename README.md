# Building a Parser from scratch

i took the exercises from the [Building a Parser from scratch](http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/courses/parser-from-scratch/)
and followed [Parser Combinators From Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP29wDx6QmW5yfO1LAgO8kU3aQEj8SIrU)
using [arcsecond](https://github.com/francisrstokes/arcsecond)

both courses are awesome~
